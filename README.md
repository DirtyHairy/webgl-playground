# What is it?

This is my personal playground for teaching myself webgl. Nothing to see here :)

# How do I use it?

If you insist on trying it out, you'll have to do a `bower install` in order to
grab the dependencies before you can run the code.

# Can I copy parts of the code?

You like my stuff so much that you want to use parts of it in your own projects?
Awsome. You are free to do so under the conditions of the MIT license. Also,
I'd be happy if you dropped me a note.
